# Logplex

Publish and Consume Logplex messages

Logplex is the Heroku log router, and can be found [here](https://github.com/heroku/logplex).

### Publishing messages

```ruby
publisher = Logplex::Publisher.new(logplex_token, logplex_url)
publisher.publish("This is a log entry")
```

Passing an array of messages to the `#publish` method will publish them all in one request,
so some latency optimization is possible:

```ruby
publisher.publish [ "And as we wind on down the road",
                    "Our shadows taller than our soul",
                    "There walks a lady we all know",
                    "Who shines white light and wants to show"]
```
